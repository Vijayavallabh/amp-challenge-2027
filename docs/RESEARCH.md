# SOTA research notes (2026-09-27)

Research pass before committing the model architecture, per the "use latest after researching"
directive. Sources are the competition's own starter kits and the recent literature.

## The organizers' SOTA baseline: AMP-Diffusion + APEX

The official `szczurek-lab/ampdiffusion-starter-kit` is the reference SOTA pipeline (an *excluded
baseline* — organizers run it, so it can't win, but its method is the bar to beat):

- **Generator:** AMP-Diffusion (Torres et al., *Cell Biomaterials* 2025; Chen et al., bioRxiv 2023;
  code `programmablebio/amp-diffusion`) — latent diffusion in **ESM-2 (esm2_t6_8M)** embedding
  space; a `Denoise_Transformer` + `GaussianDiffusion1D`, 16.54M-param EMA checkpoint, 1000-step
  sampler, decoded to sequences via the ESM-2 LM head. Deps: `fair-esm`, `torch==2.5.1`, `einops`,
  `ema-pytorch`. **Requires a CUDA GPU** — "a full CPU run of the sampler is impractically slow."
- **Ranking (top-100), the paper's filtering — no optimization/curation:**
  1. **APEX** ensemble (8 models) predicts mean MIC across an **11-pathogen panel**; take
     most-potent-first, preferring **MIC ≤ 64 µM**. APEX = `machine-biology-group-public/apex-pathogen`
     (de la Fuente lab, *Nat. Microbiol.* 2025) — the **same lab that runs this competition's wet
     lab**, so it is the best available proxy for the actual MIC measurements.
  2. **Novelty:** drop > 0.60 Smith-Waterman local-alignment similarity to known AMPs.
  3. **Diversity:** for any pair > 0.40 SW-similar, keep the lower-MIC one.
  4. Final guard: < 80% Levenshtein vs `data/antibacterial.fasta`.
- **Bundled data:** `data/training/training.fasta` (DRAMP 3.0 + APD3 + DBAASP) and
  `experimental/mic.csv` — labeled MIC data (addresses feat-007).

The `hydramp-starter-kit` is the older HydrAMP VAE (TensorFlow 2.2) — not the frontier.

## Wider literature (2024-2025)

- AMP-Diffusion (latent diffusion over ESM-2) is the current go-to for AMP generation.
- The de la Fuente lab's 2025 latent-diffusion LM (Science Advances, `sciadv.adp7171`) reports
  training-set similarity as low as ~0.57 and 25/40 synthesized peptides active — novelty +
  potency together, which is exactly what this competition scores.
- Protein-LM generators in play: ProtGPT2, ProGen (autoregressive), EvoDiff (diffusion). ESM-2 is
  the standard embedding/decoder backbone; newer ESM-C/ESM-3 exist but the whole APEX + AMP-
  Diffusion ecosystem here is ESM-2-based, so ESM-2 is the pragmatic backbone for compatibility.

## Decisions for this repo

1. **Shipped generator = our own CPU-runnable model** (feat-006/011). Rationale: AMP-Diffusion's
   sampler needs a GPU, but the validator may be CPU-only; our small AR-Transformer samples on CPU
   deterministically. AMP-Diffusion is used **offline** as an additional candidate source (feat-012).
2. **Ranking oracle = APEX** (feat-013), not a from-scratch predictor — organizer-provided and
   wet-lab-aligned. Integrated in its own isolated `uv`/subprocess env, as the starter kit does.
3. **The edge over the baseline = optimization** (feat-014): the baseline only *filters* by APEX;
   we additionally *optimize* candidates for low APEX-MIC and low hemolysis (selectivity), plus
   diversity — using the 8 H100s for large-scale generation + scoring + directed refinement.
4. **Labeled data (feat-007):** reuse the starter kit's `training.fasta` + `mic.csv` (public:
   DRAMP 3.0 / APD3 / DBAASP), with provenance in `docs/DATA.md`.

Everything above stays subject to the honesty guardrails in `docs/MODEL_PLAN.md`: predicted MIC is
APEX's estimate, not a measurement, and we report novelty/diversity and APEX validation metrics.
